    <h1 class="header">Welcome</h1>
    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Shah Ali. I like to play a lot of sports in my free time such as football and tennis. I also enjoy watching documentaries and learning new things. I have always had an interest for computers and how they work. looking up online I found 'code nation' and I decided to join because of the courses they had available and how they show that they have helped people with little to no coding experience become like pro's in such short amount of time, this had really caught my attention. I too want to learn and I believe joining code nation has been a wise decision.</p>

<p>[2] Project manager role is a role which requires a few combinations of skills and management such as marketing knowledge and account management. Strategy and execution is key as well as being highly organised, motivated and meeting deadlines. A digital project manager is pretty  much the same thing however they complete things within the digital world. A digital project manager would usually use online resources such as ebooks, videos etc to help create an effective marketing campaign. they tend to use raw digital marketing ideas and convert those ideas into actual plans based off the company's strategic objectives. Breaking down complex ideas and turning them into tasks. Some of the usual duties for digital project managers are:

        There is also quite a list for the set of skills in which you would need to be the best possible digital project manager. For example copywriting & editing; near enough all marketing positions require a person that has good writing and editing skills, making sure that things are proof read. This is so that you are able to communicate with vendors and clients effeciently as well as understanding good design and content practices to connect writers and designers.
        Problem solving is an essential skill and would be part of a digital project managers daily life. For example timeline planning, budget tracking and scope  management as well as feature planning and testing, there will always be problems to solve and not everyday will be the same
        HTML/CSS are two of the main languages which are used on the internet. Being able to code in HTML is also an advantage because it allows you as a digital project manager to help designers/devolopers, taking pressure off for the little things such as adding text, formatting text and adding embedded videos.
        It's good for digital project managers to understand the social media platform and how to use it to their advantage for when advertising.
        Many companies use the file transfer protocol to connect and transfer files on local servers and online. There are cloud services such as dropbox which allow you to do things like this.

        A good project manager must know how to work with their internal teams, external vendors and clients to meet deadlines and manage scope changes, therefore a digital project manager would need good negotion skills to attain correct timelines, rates, contracta and expectations.
        All digital project managers should be able to collect data and be able to understand it. Using platforms such as google analytics to search and find what they are looking for. A project manager would need to learn how to use any of the analytic tools the company uses.

        Project managers tend to have certain methods to manage projects from a lifecyle perspective. It would be good to gain experience in such methodoligies as Agile, Scrum and Waterfall. Being able to use popular project management tools such as Basecamp and Liquid Planner can help increase your value as project manager.

<h1>Plan and carry out tasks using IT</h1>
<p>[3] It is very important to plan out tasks and using IT to do this has made things much easier and more efficient for planning. An exampke of a good task management app would be Trello as is gives you a visual overview of what you need to work on and assigning each task to each person. It has used the Kanban system which has been used to help develope Toyota.</p>
<h1>Risks that might impact digital projects</h1>
<p>[4] There are many types of risks involved when it comes to doing projects. The most common are costs risk, schedule risk and performance risk. It is important to ensure that a good budget is chosen for the project as not having too much or too less funds can result in failure. A lot of planning and scheduling must be done or it could result in completing tasks later than expected, thus costing more time and money for the company and possibly putting the company at a slight disvantage. Performance is also a very big factor as it consists of meeting the project specification so it is important that all tasks are set out clear and completed to avoid failure. From these few examples I can say that project risks include both internal and external risks.</p>

<h1>Selecting the right technology for the job</h1>
<p>[6] Technology is intended to be used to daily tasks easier, essentially making life easier. being introduced to python, HTML, CSS, Javascript and Trello has made things easier as I was able to use Trello to plan out and organise my priorities. Using HTML has helped me code my website and CSS has helped design it. It is important to select the right technology for the right job. You should choose technology in which your team is familiar with and educate yourself and team on the foundations of computer science.</p>
<h1>How chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcome</h1>
<p>[7] Using trello has been very helpful and it is a tool i would highly recommend as it is very easy to use, the layout is very simple and helps save alot of time as planning also comes with ease of using this. Github is also a very useful tool for storing code as it also has version control which means that if you was to store an old piece of code and then later update it, it would still keep the old version of your code as well as the new one. It makes it easier to contribute to your open source projects, documentation and showcase your work. GitHub is a repository.</p>

<h1>Guidelines and constraints</h1>
<p>[5] There are many laws which are specifically related to digital marketing. One of the biggest challenges which you may face being project manager is the project constraints. They can limit and endanger the success of your project, therefore you must be aware of all the possible constraints and the project management tools which address those constraints. Three types of the usual constraints are time(whats the deadline for delivering the output) scope(what exactly is the expected outcome) and cost(how much money is available to achieve this outcome). Following the constraint procedure would help give you an idea of the time you have, the money you have and what you want the finalised project to be. </p>
<h1>Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach</h1>
<p>I am happy with the tools I have used for this website design, I had used HTML to code the website, CSS to style it and Trello to plan out and input the data which I wanted to be on the website.</p>
<h1>Describe whether the IT tools used were appropriate</h1>
<p>The IT tools that were used were appropriate I believe, this is because VSC, Codepen are used for website design and input. Trello is also very good as it makes the planning a lot easier which also helps save more time.</p>
<h1>Assess the strenghts and weaknesses of your final project</h1>
<p>Im not the most happiest about my website as I know I could have done a lot more to it, add a lot more colours and images and make it look more appealing. I could have added a navigation bar and set each question title to a page, and have the answer within that page. If I was to change it I would add more images and links which direct you to different parts of the webpage.</p>
<h1>Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h1>
<p>I could have improved my website in many different ways such as adding a background colour, inserting images and using different fonts to make it look more appealing, I could have also added a navigation bar and sitemap to help users direct themselves through the website.</p>
<h1>Review outcomes to match requirements and are fit for purpose</h1>
<p>There could have been a lot more done, I have left the website simple and basic with no colour or effects, however I believe the website meets the requirements and is fit for its purpose. </p>
<h1>Benifits and drawbacks of IT tools</h1>
<p>things I could have done to be more efficient in creating my website would be to give myself more time and use my time more wisely when creating a website, also being more creative with the design and layout however I don't find myself to be very creative, so maybe working in teams could have helped with that. Drawbacks are not every idea you have in your head can you project onto the computer screen, but can come close to what you picture in your head. </p>
<h1>Develope solutions to help own productivity</h1>
<p>using apps such as Trello can be very useful when it comes to improving productivity as it helps you organise tasks and complete them step by step. Using SEO and SEM tools are also very useful as it helps you gain knowledge about your competitors such as insight to where they get their traffic, where they rank for certain words as well as what you would need to out rank them. Ahrefs is believed to be one of the best since it claims to offer the biggest keywords and backlinks databases which help to get relevant and advance reports for your SEO activities. Another good one to use would be Serpstat.</p>
<h1>Describe ways to improve productivity and effeciency</h1>
<p>one of the many ways of improving productivity and efficiency would to be plan out properly, and make sure you follow your plans closely step by step, reducing the amount of errors, also it is very important to review and proof read what you done before it goes out there. </p>
<h1>Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h1>
<p>Almost all businesses are now going digital, consumers today now prefer to shop online as it saves a trip. Marketing budgets have now shifted to digital media.
    There are several aspects to user testing. These include:
    Usability: Where the participants in the test conduct a set of defined tasks under the watchful eye of the consultant.
    Eye Tracking: Tracking where the user’s eye movements help in understanding what they are looking for. Probing further reveals consumer behaviour patterns.
    Hallway Testing: When the software is tested at client/customer premises with users invited to participate in the testing.
    Remote Testing: When the participating users are located at remote places and testing software is used to record behaviour and experience of the users.
    Design Optimization: During the user testing, eye tracking and click-behaviour is used to test the design of the website or application. This helps optimize the design to ensure the best user experience.</p>
<h1>Describe the content and layout for each page</h1>
<p>The layout is very simple and plain, mainly just text which describes most of what I am talking about. I chose to keep it simple and plain so that there's not too much to look at and does what I intend to do.</p>
<h1>Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h1>
<p>while downloading files and viewing sites you will come across many filetype formats. most are common and you come across them quite frequently while others may require specialist programs to use them.
    here is a list of the appropriate file types for online websites.
    .AVI | .CSS | .DOC | .EXE | .GIF | .HTML/ .HTM | .JPG/ .JPEG | .MID/ .MIDI | .MP3 | .MPG/ .MPEG | .MOV/ .QT | .PDF | .PNG | .RAM | .RAR | .TIFF | .TXT | .WAV | .ZIP |</p>
<h1>Describe copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h1>
<p>copyright and other property laws can affect websites because it may restrict what you wish to publish. The best ways around this are to first get permission from the original author, second, if you wish to publish information on your site from another site, link it and maybe get permission to publish an excerpt from the original site.</p>
<h1>Webpage accessibility and users with disablities</h1>
<p>some website users may have disabilities such as, colour blindness, deaf, physical disabilities and learning disabilities. This is why web accessibility is important.
    Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can: perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web
    contribute to the Web
    Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the Web, including:
